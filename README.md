### Hi, my name is Ronit Kapoor. 
#### I am a Junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in central Massachusetts studying Computer Science. 
What pushes me is my passion of how we can further develop technology to advance human needs. I have experience in all types of programming from low level (Operating Systems, x86 ASM) to high level (machine learning, data mining). I also have experience in building in a full-stack application in a team of four and an internship at Boston Scientific. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to gain relevant experience in the Computer Science industry through an internship. 

Skills: Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, R, MATLAB, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, HTML
